# Some things that need to be fixed
#

# ($WIP$)balancing gameplay

#  map more frequently visible (maybe show it after a fight/transaction in the city?)

# Dungeons. Boss monsters are implimented, but they need somewhere to live :O

# ($WIP$) weapons and items interacting with the hero. Interesting note: should potions scale, or should they all just fullheal/restore.
